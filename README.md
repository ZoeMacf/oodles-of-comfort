### Site Styling

#### Colour Scheme

<img src="./documentation/colour_scheme/colour-scheme.PNG">

During the initial planning of the overall site design, I had gone with the above colour scheme as it I felt that it would like nice alongside the chosen images for my recipes however on adding the CSS to my index.html page the overall look was difficult to read. 

Due to this, I changed the colour scheme to more softer colours.
